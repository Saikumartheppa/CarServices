This project is a software implementation for a car service station using Object-Oriented Programming in Java.
The software provides different types of services for different types of cars and generates a detailed bill based on the type of car and requested service codes.

## Tech Used
* Java 

## Features:
- The car service station caters to different types of cars: Hatchback, Sedan, SUV.
- It provides different types of services: Basic Service, Engine Fixing, Clutch Fixing, Gear Fixing, and Brake Fixing.
- Each service has a service code associated with it and different prices for different types of cars.
- The software generates a detailed bill with the total amount for each service request based on the type of car specified and the requested service codes.
- If the total service bill is more than ‚Çπ 10000, a complimentary cleaning is provided and specified in the bill.
